# SHAP-XGB
SHAP-XGB (Shapley additive explanations-assisted XGBoost) is an algorithm for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping.
This repository contains the R scripts for conducting SHAP-XGB. In addition, an analysis example using rice heading date are also provided.

- RiceExample.R: Analysis example using rice heading date. Scripts for drawing figures are also included.
- DaysToFlowering.csv: Heading date data of rice
- Genotype.csv: Marker genotypes of rice.
- Map.csv: Map of markers.
